%2 Create a row vector a and b with given elements
a = [1 2 3 4 5]
b = [2^-1 2^-2 2^-3 2^-4 2^-5]
%2.1 Concatenate row vector a and b and diplay the new vector length
[a b]
length([a b])
%2.2 [a]*[b]
a.*b
%2.3 Convert vector b into a column vector and store it in a new vector c
c = [b]'
%2.4 Create a row vector x and a row vector y with given elements
x = [0:100];
y = [0:0.01:1];
%2.5 Compute the dot product of x and y

%2.6 Calculate the sum of x
sum(x)
